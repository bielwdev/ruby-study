count = 0

while count < 5
  puts "Count is #{count}"
  count += 1
end

# Explanation:
# The while loop in this example continues running as long as count is less 
# than 5.
# On each iteration, it prints the current value of count and then increments 
# count by 1.
# The loop stops when count reaches 5.
